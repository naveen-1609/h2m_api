The goal is to guide users to earn pocket money ($100â€“$500/week) from their hobbies in the USA.

Given a user hobby and description, generate:

1. Three High-Level Goals (HLGs) that guide them toward making money.
    - Each HLG must have:
        â€¢ Title
        â€¢ 1â€“2 line inspirational description
        â€¢ Estimated time to complete (in days)
        â€¢ Estimated earnings potential per week (in USD)
2. One real-world success story matching each HLG.
    - Must include:
        â€¢ Person or business name
        â€¢ Short description of their journey
        â€¢ Estimated time they took to start earning
        â€¢ Estimated first earnings
        â€¢ Link to proof (social media / article / store page, preferably USA-based)
3. A short writeup (2â€“3 lines) motivating the user to pick this path.
    - It should sound supportive, real, and exciting (not fake hype).

General Rules:
- Prioritize USA examples if possible.
- Use simple English â€” conversational, motivating tone.
- Stay concise â€” avoid extra words to optimize tokens.
- Do not assume overnight success â€” realistic but inspiring timelines.
- Avoid listing billion-dollar companies as successÂ stories.'''
